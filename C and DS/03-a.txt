glass = variable
water = value

variable -> names points to some memory location.don't need to worry about at which location of memory it stored.
must have to declare before using it.
declaration = announcing the properties of variable to the computer.
properties = size of the variable and name of the variable

definition of variable = allocation memory to a variable
Ex: int var;
here name of variable = var
it has int datatypes
datatypes = how much space that variable going to occupie in memory

so here you are declaring variable and requesting compiler to allowcate memory for this variable.

semicolon = seprate one statement from the other
int = 2 bytes or4 bytes

you can change value of it after words.


variable = vary- able = something that can vary over time.
constant = once defied will never change opposite of variable.
